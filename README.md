### Functionality and MVP

- [ ] Fetches data from external API
- [ ] Renders content onto the New Tab page

### Technologies

This Chrome Extension will use the basic technology: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In addition to `manifest.json` and `package.json` files, there will be two scripts:

- `api.js` that makes AJAX requests to the external API
- `page.js` that renders content onto the new tab page

There will also be one HTML and one CSS file to handle the styling.
